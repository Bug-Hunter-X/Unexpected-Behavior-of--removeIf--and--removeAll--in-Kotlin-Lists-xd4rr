This repository demonstrates a subtle difference in behavior between Kotlin's `removeIf` and `removeAll` functions when used to remove all elements from a list based on a given condition.  The `removeIf` function modifies the original list directly, while `removeAll` offers a slightly more predictable outcome in edge cases. This is important for preventing unexpected program behavior. See the included files for demonstration and solutions.
